## Exercise 2 â€“ Build a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
**Duration:** 25 minutes

1. On your new project, navigate to the **Tasks** tab.
2. Select **Edit in Project for the Web**.
3. Create the following tasks:

| Task | Duration | Predecessor | Role |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------|
| 1. Initiation | 2 days | â€” | Project Manager |

| 3. Execution | 5 days | 2 | Developer |
| 4. Testing | 3 days | 3 | QA Engineer |
| 5. Closure | 2 days | 4 | Project Manager |

4. Use **Indent/Outdent** to create hierarchy (e.g., Planning and Execution as sub-tasks).
5. Click **Save** and observe save indicators:
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green check = successful save.
   - ðŸ”µ Spinner = save in progress.
   - ðŸ”´ Red X = failure (refresh required).
6. Return to Project Operations and verify your WBS appears in Dataverse.

âœ… *Checkpoint:* Verify WBS tasks sync successfully with Dataverse (check in Timeline view).

**Duration:** 15 minutes

1. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Parameters â†’ Estimate Pricing Options**.
2. Review options:
   - **Real-Time Pricing** â€“ Auto-updates every edit.
   - **On-Demand Pricing** â€“ Requires manual update.
3. Switch to **On-Demand Pricing**.
4. Return to your project and modify task duration.
5. Observe that cost/sales rates do not change until you click **Update Prices**.

âœ… *Checkpoint:* Pricing updates only when manually triggered in On-Demand mode.

## Exercise 6 â€“ Validate Financial and Discount Posting
**Duration:** 20 minutes

1. From the project form, open **Financials â†’ Journal Entries**.
